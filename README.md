# movie-trailers

Created an application using MongoDB for the database, Java and SpringBoot for the backend, and React for the front end.

Using a seperation of concerns between the client code and the server code, I created Movies and Reviews endpoints that stored JSON collections of movies, trailers, posters, and reviews for each movie.
Linking the back end to a React web applications to display data in a user freindly way.
